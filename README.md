# NudgeIt
A jQuery Link Nudging Plugin

## Unmaintained.
You'll notice this project is 7 years old. You should use [CSS transitions](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) to achieve the same effect. No JS required. I'm leaving the repo up, but please note that it is unmaintained.
